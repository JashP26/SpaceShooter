# SpaceShooter
This is SpaceShooter, a game I created with python and pygame. I made a simple schmup game and then spent a few months adding mechanics . I implemented different types of "enemies," numerous powerups, and multiple bosses. Looking back on the game, I'm proud of what I created, and I hope that whoever downloads the executable enjoys playing my game.

Instructions to Download and Play:
Please download the .exe, img, and snd files how they are. Make sure all three files end up in the same file. Clicking the executable once downloaded should launch the game.
