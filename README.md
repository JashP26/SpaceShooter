# SpaceShooter
This is SpaceShooter, the first game I ever created with python and pygame. It started with a Youtube tutorial to make a simple schmup game, and once I finished the series,
I continued to add to the game. I added different types of "enemies," numerous powerups, and multiple bosses. Looking back on the game, I'm proud of what I created, and I hope that whoever downloads the executable enjoys playing my game.

Instructions to Download and Play:
Please download the .exe, img, and snd files how they are. Make sure all three files end up in the same file. Clicking the executable once downloaded should launch the game.
